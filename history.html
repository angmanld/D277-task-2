    <aside class="history">
        <p>Florida’s history is a rich tapestry that dates back thousands of years, with its earliest
            inhabitants being Native American tribes such as the Timucua, Calusa, and Apalachee. These indigenous people
            thrived in the region long before European contact, developing complex societies and engaging in trade
            across the Southeast. The first recorded European arrival was by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León in
            1513, who named the land “La Florida” due to its lush, flower-filled landscape. Ponce de León’s exploration
            marked the beginning of European interest in the area, leading to several expeditions and the establishment
            of settlements.</p>

        <p>In 1565, the Spanish founded St. Augustine, which remains the oldest continuously inhabited
            European-established settlement in the continental United States. St. Augustine became a key stronghold for
            Spain in the New World, serving as a base for military operations and a hub for trade. However, Florida’s
            strategic importance led to a series of conflicts between European powers, with Spain, France, and Britain
            all vying for control. In 1763, following the Seven Years’ War, Spain ceded Florida to Britain, only to
            regain it in 1783 after the American Revolutionary War. Eventually, Spain ceded Florida to the United States
            in 1821 as part of the Adams-Onís Treaty. </p>

        <p>Florida’s admission as the 27th state of the Union in 1845 was a pivotal moment in its history, setting the
            stage for its transformation into a crucial part of the Southern United States. The state’s economy,
            heavily reliant on agriculture, particularly cotton and citrus, was deeply tied to the institution of
            slavery. Florida seceded from the Union in 1861 and joined the Confederacy during the Civil War. After
            the war, Florida faced the challenges of Reconstruction, as it worked to rebuild its economy and society in
            the face of significant political and social upheaval.<p></p>
